# The UserList assignment
This React task reads a user list from a JSON file, then show them in a list with an average of their age. 
The task is a good example to work with some JavaScript principles such as ```map```, ```reduce```, and ```filter```.

# Where is the assignment coming from?
The task was a question of [This Iranian website](https://quera.ir/course/assignments/13823/problems) which was a good challenge
for me as a fresh front-end developer, then I decided to share it with you.

# How does it work?
At the first step the user list from ```users.json``` file is read, next those users who have the role of ```user```
would be shown in a list with ```userItem``` component. Finally, the average of age of those users who has the role of ```admin```
would be calculated and shown through ```AverageAge``` component.

# Conclusion
It might be a simple task at the first glance, but for those who are fresh in JavaScript and React is a really valuable challenging.
